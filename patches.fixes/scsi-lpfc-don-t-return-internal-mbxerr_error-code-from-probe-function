Subject: scsi: lpfc: Don't return internal MBXERR_ERROR code from probe
 function
Git-commit: 5c756065e47dc3e84b00577bd109f0a8e69903d7
Patch-mainline: v4.14-rc3
References: bsc#1115838

Internal error codes happen to be positive, thus the PCI driver core
won't treat them as failure, but we do. This would cause a crash later
on as lpfc_pci_remove_one() is called (e.g. as shutdown function).

Fixes: 6d368e532168 ("[SCSI] lpfc 8.3.24: Add resource extent support")
