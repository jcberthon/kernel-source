Subject: Fix unsed variable warning in has_unmovable_pages
References: bsc#1073868
Patch-mainline: Never, SUSE back-port specific

GCC complains about the following:
  mm/page_alloc.c: In function ‘has_unmovable_pages’:
  mm/page_alloc.c:7005:6: warning: unused variable ‘mt’ [-Wunused-variable]
    int mt;
        ^

Which is likely caused by:
'patches.fixes/mm-distinguish-CMA-and-MOVABLE-isolation-in-has_unmo.patch'

Get rid of 'int mt' as well.
