Subject: drm/i915: Block fbdev HPD processing during suspend
Git-commit: e8a8fedd57fdcebf0e4f24ef0fc7e29323df8e66
Patch-mainline: v5.0-rc7
References: bsc#1106929

When resuming, we check whether or not any previously connected
MST topologies are still present and if so, attempt to resume them. If
this fails, we disable said MST topologies and fire off a hotplug event
so that userspace knows to reprobe.

However, sending a hotplug event involves calling
drm_fb_helper_hotplug_event(), which in turn results in fbcon doing a
connector reprobe in the caller's thread - something we can't do at the
point in which i915 calls drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_resume() since
hotplugging hasn't been fully initialized yet.

This currently causes some rather subtle but fatal issues. For example,
on my T480s the laptop dock connected to it usually disappears during a
suspend cycle, and comes back up a short while after the system has been
resumed. This guarantees pretty much every suspend and resume cycle,
drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_set_mst(mgr, false); will be caused and in turn,
a connector hotplug will occur. Now it's Rute Goldberg time: when the
connector hotplug occurs, i915 reprobes /all/ of the connectors,
including eDP. However, eDP probing requires that we power on the panel
VDD which in turn, grabs a wakeref to the appropriate power domain on
the GPU (on my T480s, this is the PORT_DDI_A_IO domain). This is where
things start breaking, since this all happens before
intel_power_domains_enable() is called we end up leaking the wakeref
that was acquired and never releasing it later. Come next suspend/resume
cycle, this causes us to fail to shut down the GPU properly, which
causes it not to resume properly and die a horrible complicated death.

(as a note: this only happens when there's both an eDP panel and MST
topology connected which is removed mid-suspend. One or the other seems
to always be OK).

We could try to fix the VDD wakeref leak, but this doesn't seem like
it's worth it at all since we aren't able to handle hotplug detection
while resuming anyway. So, let's go with a more robust solution inspired
by nouveau: block fbdev from handling hotplug events until we resume
fbdev. This allows us to still send sysfs hotplug events to be handled
later by user space while we're resuming, while also preventing us from
actually processing any hotplug events we receive until it's safe.

This fixes the wakeref leak observed on the T480s and as such, also
fixes suspend/resume with MST topologies connected on this machine.

Changes since v2:
* Don't call drm_fb_helper_hotplug_event() under lock, do it after lock
  (Chris Wilson)
* Don't call drm_fb_helper_hotplug_event() in
  intel_fbdev_output_poll_changed() under lock (Chris Wilson)
* Always set ifbdev->hpd_waiting (Chris Wilson)
