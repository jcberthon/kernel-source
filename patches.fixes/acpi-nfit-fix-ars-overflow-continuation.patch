Subject: acpi, nfit: Fix ARS overflow continuation
Git-commit: 3fa58dcab50a0aa16817f16a8d38aee869eb3fb9
Patch-mainline: v4.20-rc3
References: bsc#1125000

When the platform BIOS is unable to report all the media error records
it requires the OS to restart the scrub at a prescribed location. The
driver detects the overflow condition, but then fails to report it to
the ARS state machine after reaping the records. Propagate -ENOSPC
correctly to continue the ARS operation.
