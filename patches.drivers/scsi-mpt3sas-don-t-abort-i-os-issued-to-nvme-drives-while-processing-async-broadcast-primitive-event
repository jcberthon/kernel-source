Subject: scsi: mpt3sas: Don't abort I/Os issued to NVMe drives while
 processing Async Broadcast primitive event.
Git-commit: 999c85134db71599698917775f35fd56ced2dc0a
Patch-mainline: v4.19-rc1
References: bsc#1117108

Linux driver when receives Broadcast Asynchronous Event Notification (BAEN)
from the controller firmware, checks all pending I/Os at the driver level
and issues query task, abort task TMs. This is done in the driver to handle
drives which are connected with multiple initiators and undergoing target
resets. In the BAEN handling code, the I/Os issued to NVMe drives are also
handled and query task and abort task TMs are issued, which are not
necessary as there is no multi-initiator and no BAEN concept with NVMe
drives. Hence when the driver checks for pending I/Os it skips NVMe drives
at this moment.
