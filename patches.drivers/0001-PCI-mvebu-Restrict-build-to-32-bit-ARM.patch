Subject: PCI: mvebu: Restrict build to 32-bit ARM
Git-commit: 61d9e854dfb91b46b99ffd3d31fc7d45d2b95f31
Patch-mainline: v4.5-rc6
References: fate#319899 fate#320700

This driver uses PCI glue that is only available on 32-bit ARM.  This used
to work fine as long as ARCH_MVEBU and ARCH_DOVE were exclusively 32-bit,
but there's a patch in the pipe to make ARCH_MVEBU also available on 64-bit
ARM.
