Subject: [PATCH 12/47] arm64: Honor nosmp kernel command line option

Git-commit: e75118a7b581b19b08282c7819c1ec6f68b91b79
Patch-mainline: v4.8-rc1
References: fate#322326

Passing "nosmp" should boot the kernel with a single processor, without
provision to enable secondary CPUs even if they are present. "nosmp" is
implemented by setting maxcpus=0. At the moment we still mark the secondary
CPUs present even with nosmp, which allows the userspace to bring them
up. This patch corrects the smp_prepare_cpus() to honor the maxcpus == 0.

Commit 44dbcc93ab67145 ("arm64: Fix behavior of maxcpus=N") fixed the
behavior for maxcpus >= 1, but broke maxcpus = 0.
