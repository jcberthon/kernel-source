Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/realtek - set PINCFG_HEADSET_MIC to parse_flags
Git-commit: 3ce0d5aa265bcc0a4b281cb0cabf92491276101b
Patch-mainline: v4.17-rc2
References: bsc#1099810

Otherwise, the pin will be regarded as microphone, and the jack name
is "Mic Phantom", it is always on in the pulseaudio even nothing is
plugged into the jack. So the UI is confusing to users since the
microphone always shows up in the UI even there is no microphone
plugged.

After adding this flag, the jack name is "Headset Mic Phantom", then
the pulseaudio can handle its detection correctly.
