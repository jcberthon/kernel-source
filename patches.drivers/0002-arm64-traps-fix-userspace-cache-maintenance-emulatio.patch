Subject: [PATCH 2/3] arm64: traps: fix userspace cache maintenance emulation
 on a tagged pointer

Git-commit: 81cddd65b5c82758ea5571a25e31ff6f1f89ff02
Patch-mainline: v4.12-rc1
References: bsc#1039273

When we emulate userspace cache maintenance in the kernel, we can
currently send the task a SIGSEGV even though the maintenance was done
on a valid address. This happens if the address has a non-zero address
tag, and happens to not be mapped in.

When we get the address from a user register, we don't currently remove
the address tag before performing cache maintenance on it. If the
maintenance faults, we end up in either __do_page_fault, where find_vma
can't find the VMA if the address has a tag, or in do_translation_fault,
where the tagged address will appear to be above TASK_SIZE. In both
cases, the address is not mapped in, and the task is sent a SIGSEGV.

This patch removes the tag from the address before using it. With this
patch, the fault is handled correctly, the address gets mapped in, and
the cache maintenance succeeds.

As a second bug, if cache maintenance (correctly) fails on an invalid
tagged address, the address gets passed into arm64_notify_segfault,
where find_vma fails to find the VMA due to the tag, and the wrong
si_code may be sent as part of the siginfo_t of the segfault. With this
patch, the correct si_code is sent.
