Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix mic and headset jack sense on Asus X705UD
Git-commit: 28e8af8a163ed6afe9498f1d499a5061c2214755
Patch-mainline: v4.12-rc5
References: bsc#1099810

The ASUS X705UD laptop requires the known fixup ALC256_FIXUP_ASUS_MIC
in order to fix headphone jack sensing and to enable use of the internal
microphone.

Unfortunately jack sensing for the headset mic is still not working.

[rearranged the position to keep the PCI SSID order -- tiwai]
