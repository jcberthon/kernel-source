Subject: xen: x86-non-upstream-eager-fpu external modules fix
Patch-mainline: Never, SUSE-Xen specific
References: bnc#1087086 CVE-2018-3665 bnc#1100091 bnc#1099598

This is a fix for:
patches.suse/x86-non-upstream-eager-fpu.patch

We silently broke kABI in that patch (kernel_fpu_begin/end are inlines)
and customers started seeing crashes due to added BUG_ON in
do_device_not_available. Fix this by soften it to a WARNING and do clts
to recover.

Note that the warning is printed in a ratelimit manner.
