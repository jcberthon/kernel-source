Subject: [PATCH] block/swim3: Fix -EBUSY error when re-opening device after
 unmount
Git-commit: 296dcc40f2f2e402facf7cd26cf3f2c8f4b17d47
Patch-mainline: v5.0-rc1
References: Git-fixes

When the block device is opened with FMODE_EXCL, ref_count is set to -1.
This value doesn't get reset when the device is closed which means the
device cannot be opened again. Fix this by checking for refcount <= 0
in the release method.
