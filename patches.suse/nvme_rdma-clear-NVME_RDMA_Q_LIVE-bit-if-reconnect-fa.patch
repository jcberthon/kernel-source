Subject: [PATCH] nvme_rdma: clear NVME_RDMA_Q_LIVE bit if reconnect fails
References: bsc#1083770
Patch-Mainline: Never, SLE12-SP3 specific

When starting reconnection we correctly unset the NVME_RDMA_Q_LIVE
bit, and set if once the reconnect is attempted.
However, we never clear that bit again if the reconnect attempt
failed.
