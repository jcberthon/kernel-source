Subject: [PATCH 075/101] irqchip: bcm2836: Use a more generic memory barrier
 call
Git-commit: a1dcbd11d09be1cb357b2f217c0eaa1461128da0
Patch-mainline: v4.7-rc1
References: FATE#319481

dsb() requires an argument on arm64, so we needed to add "sy".
Instead, take this opportunity to switch to the same smp_wmb() call
that gic uses for its IPIs.  This is a less strong barrier than we
were doing before (dmb(ishst) compared to dsb(sy)), but it seems to be
the correct one.
