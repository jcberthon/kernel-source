Subject: [PATCH 15/40] arm64: mm: Temporarily disable ARM64_SW_TTBR0_PAN

Git-commit: 376133b7edc20f237a42e4c72415cc9e8c0a9704
Patch-mainline: v4.16-rc1
References: bsc#1068032

We're about to rework the way ASIDs are allocated, switch_mm is
implemented and low-level kernel entry/exit is handled, so keep the
ARM64_SW_TTBR0_PAN code out of the way whilst we do the heavy lifting.

It will be re-enabled in a subsequent patch.
