Subject: [PATCH] x86/pti: don't report XenPV as vulnerable
References: bsc#1097551
Git-commit: 6cb2b08ff92460290979de4be91363e5d1b6cec1
Patch-mainline: v4.18-rc2

Xen PV domain kernel is not by design affected by meltdown as it's enforcing
split CR3 itself. Let's not report such systems as "Vulnerable" in sysfs (we're
also already forcing PTI to off in X86_HYPER_XEN_PV cases); the
security of the system ultimately depends on presence of mitigation in
Hypervisor, which can't be easily detected from DomU; let's report that.
