Subject: [PATCH] clk: imx6q: reset exclusive gates on init
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.172
Git-commit: f7542d817733f461258fd3a47d77da35b2d9fc81

[ Upstream commit f7542d817733f461258fd3a47d77da35b2d9fc81 ]

The exclusive gates may be set up in the wrong way by software running
before the clock driver comes up. In that case the exclusive setup is
locked in its initial state, as the complementary function can't be
activated without disabling the initial setup first.

To avoid this lock situation, reset the exclusive gates to the off
state and allow the kernel to provide the proper setup.
