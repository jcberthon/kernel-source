Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: svm: report MSR_IA32_MCG_EXT_CTL as unsupported

[ Upstream commit e87555e550cef4941579cd879759a7c0dee24e68 ]

AMD doesn't seem to implement MSR_IA32_MCG_EXT_CTL and svm code in kvm
knows nothing about it, however, this MSR is among emulated_msrs and
thus returned with KVM_GET_MSR_INDEX_LIST. The consequent KVM_GET_MSRS,
of course, fails.

Report the MSR as unsupported to not confuse userspace.
