Subject: [PATCH] arm64: kernel: Include _AC definition in page.h
Patch-mainline: 4.4.178
References: FATE#320672 bnc#1012382
Git-commit: 812264550dcba6cdbe84bfac2f27e7d23b5b8733

[ Upstream commit 812264550dcba6cdbe84bfac2f27e7d23b5b8733 ]

page.h uses '_AC' in the definition of PAGE_SIZE, but doesn't include
linux/const.h where this is defined. This produces build warnings when only
asm/page.h is included by asm code.
