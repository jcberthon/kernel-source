Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/pseries/cpuidle: Fix preempt warning

[ Upstream commit 2b038cbc5fcf12a7ee1cc9bfd5da1e46dacdee87 ]

When booting a pseries kernel with PREEMPT enabled, it dumps the
following warning:

   BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code: swapper/0/1
   caller is pseries_processor_idle_init+0x5c/0x22c

This happens because the code calls get_lppaca() which calls
get_paca() and it checks if preemption is disabled through
check_preemption_disabled().

Preemption should be disabled because the per CPU variable may make no
sense if there is a preemption (and a CPU switch) after it reads the
per CPU data and when it is used.

In this device driver specifically, it is not a problem, because this
code just needs to have access to one lppaca struct, and it does not
matter if it is the current per CPU lppaca struct or not (i.e. when
there is a preemption and a CPU migration).

That said, the most appropriate fix seems to be related to avoiding
the debug_smp_processor_id() call at get_paca(), instead of calling
preempt_disable() before get_paca().
