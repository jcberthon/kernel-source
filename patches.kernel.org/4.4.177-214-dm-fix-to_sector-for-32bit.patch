Subject: [PATCH] dm: fix to_sector() for 32bit
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.177
Git-commit: 0bdb50c531f7377a9da80d3ce2d61f389c84cb30

commit 0bdb50c531f7377a9da80d3ce2d61f389c84cb30 upstream.

A dm-raid array with devices larger than 4GB won't assemble on
a 32 bit host since _check_data_dev_sectors() was added in 4.16.
This is because to_sector() treats its argument as an "unsigned long"
which is 32bits (4GB) on a 32bit host.  Using "unsigned long long"
is more correct.

Kernels as early as 4.2 can have other problems due to to_sector()
being used on the size of a device.

Fixes: 0cf4503174c1 ("dm raid: add support for the MD RAID0 personality")
