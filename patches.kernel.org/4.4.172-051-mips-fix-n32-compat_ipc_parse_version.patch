Subject: [PATCH] mips: fix n32 compat_ipc_parse_version
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.172
Git-commit: 5a9372f751b5350e0ce3d2ee91832f1feae2c2e5

commit 5a9372f751b5350e0ce3d2ee91832f1feae2c2e5 upstream.

While reading through the sysvipc implementation, I noticed that the n32
semctl/shmctl/msgctl system calls behave differently based on whether
o32 support is enabled or not: Without o32, the IPC_64 flag passed by
user space is rejected but calls without that flag get IPC_64 behavior.

As far as I can tell, this was inadvertently changed by a cleanup patch
but never noticed by anyone, possibly nobody has tried using sysvipc
on n32 after linux-3.19.

Change it back to the old behavior now.
