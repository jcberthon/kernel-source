Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: Always try all copies when reading extent buffers
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.167
Git-commit: f8397d69daef06d358430d3054662fb597e37c00

commit f8397d69daef06d358430d3054662fb597e37c00 upstream.

When a metadata read is served the endio routine btree_readpage_end_io_hook
is called which eventually runs the tree-checker. If tree-checker fails
to validate the read eb then it sets EXTENT_BUFFER_CORRUPT flag. This
leads to btree_read_extent_buffer_pages wrongly assuming that all
available copies of this extent buffer are wrong and failing prematurely.
Fix this modify btree_read_extent_buffer_pages to read all copies of
the data.

This failure was exhibitted in xfstests btrfs/124 which would
spuriously fail its balance operations. The reason was that when balance
was run following re-introduction of the missing raid1 disk
__btrfs_map_block would map the read request to stripe 0, which
corresponded to devid 2 (the disk which is being removed in the test):

    item 2 key (FIRST_CHUNK_TREE CHUNK_ITEM 3553624064) itemoff 15975 itemsize 112
	length 1073741824 owner 2 stripe_len 65536 type DATA|RAID1
	io_align 65536 io_width 65536 sector_size 4096
	num_stripes 2 sub_stripes 1
		stripe 0 devid 2 offset 2156920832
		dev_uuid 8466c350-ed0c-4c3b-b17d-6379b445d5c8
		stripe 1 devid 1 offset 3553624064
		dev_uuid 1265d8db-5596-477e-af03-df08eb38d2ca

This caused read requests for a checksum item that to be routed to the
stale disk which triggered the aforementioned logic involving
EXTENT_BUFFER_CORRUPT flag. This then triggered cascading failures of
the balance operation.
