Subject: [PATCH] cifs: check ntwrk_buf_start for NULL before dereferencing it
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.175
Git-commit: 59a63e479ce36a3f24444c3a36efe82b78e4a8e0

[ Upstream commit 59a63e479ce36a3f24444c3a36efe82b78e4a8e0 ]

RHBZ: 1021460

There is an issue where when multiple threads open/close the same directory
ntwrk_buf_start might end up being NULL, causing the call to smbCalcSize
later to oops with a NULL deref.

The real bug is why this happens and why this can become NULL for an
open cfile, which should not be allowed.
This patch tries to avoid a oops until the time when we fix the underlying
issue.
