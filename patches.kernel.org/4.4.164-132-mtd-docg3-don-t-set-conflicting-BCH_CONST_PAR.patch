Subject: [PATCH] mtd: docg3: don't set conflicting BCH_CONST_PARAMS option
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.164
Git-commit: be2e1c9dcf76886a83fb1c433a316e26d4ca2550

commit be2e1c9dcf76886a83fb1c433a316e26d4ca2550 upstream.

I noticed during the creation of another bugfix that the BCH_CONST_PARAMS
option that is set by DOCG3 breaks setting variable parameters for any
other users of the BCH library code.

The only other user we have today is the MTD_NAND software BCH
implementation (most flash controllers use hardware BCH these days
and are not affected). I considered removing BCH_CONST_PARAMS entirely
because of the inherent conflict, but according to the description in
lib/bch.c there is a significant performance benefit in keeping it.

To avoid the immediate problem of the conflict between MTD_NAND_BCH
and DOCG3, this only sets the constant parameters if MTD_NAND_BCH
is disabled, which should fix the problem for all cases that
are affected. This should also work for all stable kernels.

Note that there is only one machine that actually seems to use the
DOCG3 driver (arch/arm/mach-pxa/mioa701.c), so most users should have
the driver disabled, but it almost certainly shows up if we wanted
to test random kernels on machines that use software BCH in MTD.
