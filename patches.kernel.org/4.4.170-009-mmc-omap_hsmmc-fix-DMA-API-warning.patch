Subject: [PATCH] mmc: omap_hsmmc: fix DMA API warning
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.170
Git-commit: 0b479790684192ab7024ce6a621f93f6d0a64d92

commit 0b479790684192ab7024ce6a621f93f6d0a64d92 upstream.

While booting with rootfs on MMC, the following warning is encountered
on OMAP4430:

omap-dma-engine 4a056000.dma-controller: DMA-API: mapping sg segment longer than device claims to support [len=69632] [max=65536]

This is because the DMA engine has a default maximum segment size of 64K
but HSMMC sets:

        mmc->max_blk_size = 512;       /* Block Length at max can be 1024 */
        mmc->max_blk_count = 0xFFFF;    /* No. of Blocks is 16 bits */
        mmc->max_req_size = mmc->max_blk_size * mmc->max_blk_count;
        mmc->max_seg_size = mmc->max_req_size;

which ends up telling the block layer that we support a maximum segment
size of 65535*512, which exceeds the advertised DMA engine capabilities.

Fix this by clamping the maximum segment size to the lower of the
maximum request size and of the DMA engine device used for either DMA
channel.
