Subject: [PATCH] Btrfs: memset to avoid stale content in btree node block
Patch-mainline: 4.4.171
References: bnc#1012382 bsc#1012452
Git-commit: 3eb548ee3a8042d95ad81be254e67a5222c24e03

commit 3eb548ee3a8042d95ad81be254e67a5222c24e03 upstream.

During updating btree, we could push items between sibling
nodes/leaves, for leaves data sections starts reversely from
the end of the block while for nodes we only have key pairs
which are stored one by one from the start of the block.

So we could do try to push key pairs from one node to the next
node right in the tree, and after that, we update the node's
nritems to reflect the correct end while leaving the stale
content in the node.  One may intentionally corrupt the fs
image and access the stale content by bumping the nritems and
causes various crashes.

This takes the in-memory @nritems as the correct one and
gets to memset the unused part of a btree node.
