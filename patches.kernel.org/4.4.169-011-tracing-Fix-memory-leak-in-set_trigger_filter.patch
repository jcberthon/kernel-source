Subject: [PATCH] tracing: Fix memory leak in set_trigger_filter()
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.169
Git-commit: 3cec638b3d793b7cacdec5b8072364b41caeb0e1

commit 3cec638b3d793b7cacdec5b8072364b41caeb0e1 upstream.

When create_event_filter() fails in set_trigger_filter(), the filter may
still be allocated and needs to be freed. The caller expects the
data->filter to be updated with the new filter, even if the new filter
failed (we could add an error message by setting set_str parameter of
create_event_filter(), but that's another update).

But because the error would just exit, filter was left hanging and
nothing could free it.

Found by kmemleak detector.
