Subject: [PATCH] net: phy: don't allow __set_phy_supported to add unsupported
 modes
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.168
Git-commit: d2a36971ef595069b7a600d1144c2e0881a930a1

[ Upstream commit d2a36971ef595069b7a600d1144c2e0881a930a1 ]

Currently __set_phy_supported allows to add modes w/o checking whether
the PHY supports them. This is wrong, it should never add modes but
only remove modes we don't want to support.

The commit marked as fixed didn't do anything wrong, it just copied
existing functionality to the helper which is being fixed now.

Fixes: f3a6bd393c2c ("phylib: Add phy_set_max_speed helper")
