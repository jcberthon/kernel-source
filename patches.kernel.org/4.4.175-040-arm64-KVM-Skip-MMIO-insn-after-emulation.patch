[ Upstream commit 0d640732dbebed0f10f18526de21652931f0b2f2 ]

When we emulate an MMIO instruction, we advance the CPU state within
decode_hsr(), before emulating the instruction effects.

Having this logic in decode_hsr() is opaque, and advancing the state
before emulation is problematic. It gets in the way of applying
consistent single-step logic, and it prevents us from being able to fail
an MMIO instruction with a synchronous exception.

Clean this up by only advancing the CPU state *after* the effects of the
instruction are emulated.
