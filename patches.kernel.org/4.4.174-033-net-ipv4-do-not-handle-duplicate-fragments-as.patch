Subject: [PATCH] net: ipv4: do not handle duplicate fragments as overlapping
Patch-mainline: 4.4.174
References: bnc#1012382 bsc#1116345
Git-commit: ade446403bfb79d3528d56071a84b15351a139ad

commit ade446403bfb79d3528d56071a84b15351a139ad upstream.

Since commit 7969e5c40dfd ("ip: discard IPv4 datagrams with overlapping
segments.") IPv4 reassembly code drops the whole queue whenever an
overlapping fragment is received. However, the test is written in a way
which detects duplicate fragments as overlapping so that in environments
with many duplicate packets, fragmented packets may be undeliverable.

Add an extra test and for (potentially) duplicate fragment, only drop the
new fragment rather than the whole queue. Only starting offset and length
are checked, not the contents of the fragments as that would be too
expensive. For similar reason, linear list ("run") of a rbtree node is not
iterated, we only check if the new fragment is a subset of the interval
covered by existing consecutive fragments.

v2: instead of an exact check iterating through linear list of an rbtree
node, only check if the new fragment is subset of the "run" (suggested
by Eric Dumazet)

Fixes: 7969e5c40dfd ("ip: discard IPv4 datagrams with overlapping segments.")

[bwh: Backported to 4.4:
 - goto discard_qp, not err, in case of overlap
 - Set err earlier variable, as done upstream in commit 0ff89efb5246
