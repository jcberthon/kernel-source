Subject: [PATCH] scsi: megaraid_sas: fix a missing-check bug
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.164
Git-commit: 47db7873136a9c57c45390a53b57019cf73c8259

[ Upstream commit 47db7873136a9c57c45390a53b57019cf73c8259 ]

In megasas_mgmt_compat_ioctl_fw(), to handle the structure
compat_megasas_iocpacket 'cioc', a user-space structure megasas_iocpacket
'ioc' is allocated before megasas_mgmt_ioctl_fw() is invoked to handle
the packet. Since the two data structures have different fields, the data
is copied from 'cioc' to 'ioc' field by field. In the copy process,
'sense_ptr' is prepared if the field 'sense_len' is not null, because it
will be used in megasas_mgmt_ioctl_fw(). To prepare 'sense_ptr', the
user-space data 'ioc->sense_off' and 'cioc->sense_off' are copied and
saved to kernel-space variables 'local_sense_off' and 'user_sense_off'
respectively. Given that 'ioc->sense_off' is also copied from
'cioc->sense_off', 'local_sense_off' and 'user_sense_off' should have the
same value. However, 'cioc' is in the user space and a malicious user can
race to change the value of 'cioc->sense_off' after it is copied to
'ioc->sense_off' but before it is copied to 'user_sense_off'. By doing
so, the attacker can inject different values into 'local_sense_off' and
'user_sense_off'. This can cause undefined behavior in the following
execution, because the two variables are supposed to be same.

This patch enforces a check on the two kernel variables 'local_sense_off'
and 'user_sense_off' to make sure they are the same after the copy. In
case they are not, an error code EINVAL will be returned.
