Subject: [PATCH] arm64: support keyctl() system call in 32-bit mode
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.178
Git-commit: 5c2a625937ba49bc691089370638223d310cda9a

[ Upstream commit 5c2a625937ba49bc691089370638223d310cda9a ]

As is the case for a number of other architectures that have a 32-bit
compat mode, enable KEYS_COMPAT if both COMPAT and KEYS are enabled.
This allows AArch32 programs to use the keyctl() system call when
running on an AArch64 kernel.
