Subject: [PATCH] ipv6: Consider sk_bound_dev_if when binding a socket to an
 address
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.173
Git-commit: c5ee066333ebc322a24a00a743ed941a0c68617e

[ Upstream commit c5ee066333ebc322a24a00a743ed941a0c68617e ]

IPv6 does not consider if the socket is bound to a device when binding
to an address. The result is that a socket can be bound to eth0 and then
bound to the address of eth1. If the device is a VRF, the result is that
a socket can only be bound to an address in the default VRF.

Resolve by considering the device if sk_bound_dev_if is set.

This problem exists from the beginning of git history.
