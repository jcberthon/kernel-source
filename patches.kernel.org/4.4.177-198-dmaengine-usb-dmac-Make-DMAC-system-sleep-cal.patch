Subject: [PATCH] dmaengine: usb-dmac: Make DMAC system sleep callbacks
 explicit
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.177
Git-commit: d9140a0da4a230a03426d175145989667758aa6a

commit d9140a0da4a230a03426d175145989667758aa6a upstream.

This commit fixes the issue that USB-DMAC hangs silently after system
resumes on R-Car Gen3 hence renesas_usbhs will not work correctly
when using USB-DMAC for bulk transfer e.g. ethernet or serial
gadgets.

The issue can be reproduced by these steps:
 1. modprobe g_serial
 2. Suspend and resume system.
 3. connect a usb cable to host side
 4. Transfer data from Host to Target
 5. cat /dev/ttyGS0 (Target side)
 6. echo "test" > /dev/ttyACM0 (Host side)

The 'cat' will not result anything. However, system still can work
normally.

Currently, USB-DMAC driver does not have system sleep callbacks hence
this driver relies on the PM core to force runtime suspend/resume to
suspend and reinitialize USB-DMAC during system resume. After
the commit 17218e0092f8 ("PM / genpd: Stop/start devices without
pm_runtime_force_suspend/resume()"), PM core will not force
runtime suspend/resume anymore so this issue happens.

To solve this, make system suspend resume explicit by using
pm_runtime_force_{suspend,resume}() as the system sleep callbacks.
SET_NOIRQ_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS() is used to make sure USB-DMAC
suspended after and initialized before renesas_usbhs."
