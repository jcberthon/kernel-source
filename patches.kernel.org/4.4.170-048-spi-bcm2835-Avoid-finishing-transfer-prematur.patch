Subject: [PATCH] spi: bcm2835: Avoid finishing transfer prematurely in IRQ
 mode

commit 56c1723426d3cfd4723bfbfce531d7b38bae6266 upstream.

The IRQ handler bcm2835_spi_interrupt() first reads as much as possible
from the RX FIFO, then writes as much as possible to the TX FIFO.
Afterwards it decides whether the transfer is finished by checking if
the TX FIFO is empty.

If very few bytes were written to the TX FIFO, they may already have
been transmitted by the time the FIFO's emptiness is checked.  As a
result, the transfer will be declared finished and the chip will be
reset without reading the corresponding received bytes from the RX FIFO.

The odds of this happening increase with a high clock frequency (such
that the TX FIFO drains quickly) and either passing "threadirqs" on the
command line or enabling CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT_BASE (such that the IRQ
handler may be preempted between filling the TX FIFO and checking its
emptiness).

Fix by instead checking whether rx_len has reached zero, which means
that the transfer has been received in full.  This is also more
efficient as it avoids one bus read access per interrupt.  Note that
bcm2835_spi_transfer_one_poll() likewise uses rx_len to determine
whether the transfer has finished.
