Subject: [PATCH] perf intel-pt: Fix TSC slip
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.178
Git-commit: f3b4e06b3bda759afd042d3d5fa86bea8f1fe278

commit f3b4e06b3bda759afd042d3d5fa86bea8f1fe278 upstream.

A TSC packet can slip past MTC packets so that the timestamp appears to
go backwards. One estimate is that can be up to about 40 CPU cycles,
which is certainly less than 0x1000 TSC ticks, but accept slippage an
order of magnitude more to be on the safe side.
