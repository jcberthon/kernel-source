Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: seq: oss: Fix Spectre v1 vulnerability
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.178
Git-commit: c709f14f0616482b67f9fbcb965e1493a03ff30b

commit c709f14f0616482b67f9fbcb965e1493a03ff30b upstream.

dev is indirectly controlled by user-space, hence leading to
a potential exploitation of the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability.

This issue was detected with the help of Smatch:

sound/core/seq/oss/seq_oss_synth.c:626 snd_seq_oss_synth_make_info() warn: potential spectre issue 'dp->synths' [w] (local cap)

Fix this by sanitizing dev before using it to index dp->synths.

Notice that given that speculation windows are large, the policy is
to kill the speculation on the first load and not worry if it can be
completed with a dependent load/store [1].
