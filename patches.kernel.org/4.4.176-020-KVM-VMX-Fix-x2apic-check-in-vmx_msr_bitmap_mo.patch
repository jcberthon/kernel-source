Subject: [PATCH] KVM: VMX: Fix x2apic check in vmx_msr_bitmap_mode()
References: bnc#1012382 bsc#1124166
Patch-mainline: 4.4.176
Git-commit: 49e1a9d1169adcffee99967130ff6d3b79d5fbe6

The stable backport of upstream commit

	904e14fb7cb96 KVM: VMX: make MSR bitmaps per-VCPU

has a bug in vmx_msr_bitmap_mode(). It enables the x2apic
MSR-bitmap when the kernel emulates x2apic for the guest in
software. The upstream version of the commit checkes whether
the hardware has virtualization enabled for x2apic
emulation.

Since KVM emulates x2apic for guests even when the host does
not support x2apic in hardware, this causes the intercept of
at least the X2APIC_TASKPRI MSR to be disabled on machines
not supporting that MSR. The result is undefined behavior,
on some machines (Intel Westmere based) it causes a crash of
the guest kernel when it tries to access that MSR.

Change the check in vmx_msr_bitmap_mode() to match the upstream
code. This fixes the guest crashes observed with stable
kernels starting with v4.4.168 through v4.4.175.
