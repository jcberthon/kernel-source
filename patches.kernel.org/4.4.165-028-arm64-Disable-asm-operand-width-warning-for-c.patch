Subject: [PATCH] arm64: Disable asm-operand-width warning for clang
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.165
Git-commit: 2b92e27f26f136b9c16a0ccb94a89ff599814675

clang raises 'asm-operand-widths' warnings in inline assembly code when
the size of an operand is < 64 bits and the operand width is unspecified.
Most warnings are raised in macros, i.e. the datatype of the operand may
vary.

nc: I trimmed the original commit message since I'm not a part of CrOS
    and can't speak on their behalf.

    To fix these warnings, it requires a fairly intrusive backport of
    the sysreg conversion that Mark Rutland did in 4.9. I think
    disabling the warning is smarter, similar to commit d41d0fe374d4
    ("turn off -Wattribute-alias") in this tree.
